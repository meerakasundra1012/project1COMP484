        <h2 class="section-title">Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul class="fun-facts">
          <li>J.K. Rowling wrote much of the first book in cafés in Edinburgh while raising her daughter as a single parent.</li>
          <li>The series was originally published as "Philosopher's Stone" in the UK and "Sorcerer's Stone" in the US.</li>
          <li>Each book corresponds to one school year at Hogwarts, so Harry ages from 11 to 17 across the series.</li>
          <li>Rowling had the entire plot planned out before finishing the first book—including the fate of major characters.</li>
          <li>Hogwarts has four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, each with distinct values and colors.</li>
